# Nike-Vs-Adidas-Consumer-Analysis
I recently explored consumer review patterns for Nike and Adidas products, leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights. Using R, I applied:

✅ Web Scraping & Data Cleaning – Automated data collection and structured product information for comparison 
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Used boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to assess consumer behavior 
✅ Clustering & Pattern Recognition – Implemented DBSCAN clustering and optimized parameters via KNN distance plots 
✅ Data Visualization with ggplot2 – Generated density plots, sales price trends, and cluster comparisons 

✅ Key Findings:
Nike products with higher sale prices tend to receive better ratings 🏅
Adidas maintains strong ratings regardless of discount level, showcasing brand loyalty 🔥
Consumers engage more with highly rated products, as seen in review count clusters
